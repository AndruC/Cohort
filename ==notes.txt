Functional Specs

Each campaign will have its own sessions
A session is made up of one 'thread' of turn.
A GM can create a new event (intended to be weekly?) and begin with a 'turn'
A player can create a turn as a reply to the event trunk, listed in chronological order.
A player can reply to another piece, branching off of the trunk.
A piece contains a message, IS a child of another piece, or the root node.
